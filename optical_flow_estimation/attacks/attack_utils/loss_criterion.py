    Compute the  endpoint errors (EPEs) between two flow fields.
    The epe measures the euclidean- / 2-norm of the difference of two optical flow vectors
    (u0, v0) and (u1, v1) and is defined as sqrt((u0 - u1)^2 + (v0 - v1)^2).

    Args:
        flow1 (tensor):
            represents a flow field with dimension (2,M,N) or (b,2,M,N) where M ~ u-component and N ~v-component
        flow2 (tensor):
            represents a flow field with dimension (2,M,N) or (b,2,M,N) where M ~ u-component and N ~v-component

    Raises:
        ValueError: dimensons not valid

    Returns:
